# 1. Getter
## Contracts

In ethers.js, the Contract provides an easy way to communicate with our Solidity contracts!

To create a Contract instance, we pass an ABI which is used to understand the contract methods. The construction of the instance will dynamically add these methods to the instance object itself.

All we need to do is invoke these dynamic methods.

Let's consider the following contract:
```
// Example.sol
contract Example {
    function getNumber() external pure returns(uint) {
        return 3;
    }
}
```
☝️ We can take this Solidity contract, compile it and create an ethers.js contract instance with the bytecode and abi.

Then we can deploy the contract and interact with it from JavaScript:
```js
// getNumber.js
async function getNumber(contract) {
    const number = await contract.getNumber();
    console.log(number); // 3
}
```
☝️ Here, `contract` is an ethers.js contract instance that has dynamically created the `getNumber` function based on the ABI of the Example contract.

We can invoke this `getNumber` function which returns a promise that resolves with the value we were looking for. Nice and easy! 👏
## 🏁 Your Goal: Get The Value

In the `contract.sol` file there is a public state variable called `value`.

1. Your goal is to complete the function in `index.js` to retrieve this `value`.
2. This function can either return the promise from invoking the method or you can make the `getValue` function `async` and return the value.

    💡 Returning a promise that resolves with a value or returning a value in an async function result in essentially the same functionality, afterall! 😃

# 2. Setter
## Transactions

In the last stage we made a **call** to the `value` getter. This call required no gas and made no modifications to the contract storage.

In this stage we will be modifying a value in the contract storage. This will require us to make a **transaction** and spend gas. Fortunately, the contract api for this isn't much different at all!

Consider this contract:
```
// Switch.sol
contract Switch {
    bool isOn;

    function change(bool _isOn) external {
        isOn = _isOn;
    }
}
```
Once again, ethers.js will provide us with a dynamic function called `change` on the contract instance:
```js
// turnOnSwitch.js
function turnOnSwitch(contract) {
    return contract.change(true);
}
```
☝️ This function will set the `isOn` state variable to `true` and return the transaction promise.

The reason this is so simple is because the contract is linked to a Signer. The Signer represents an EOA. With it, we can sign a transaction before we broadcast it to the network. Since the contract is already associated with the signer, ethers.js can do this automatically.

    📖 In the previous ethers.js tutorial we specifically worked with ethers Wallets. Wallets implement the Signer API with additional functionality.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Modify Value

In `contract.sol` you'll see there is a `uint` state variable called `value`.

1. Your goal is to call the `modify()` function on this `value` from the `setValue` function in `index.js.`
2. The default value for a uint is `0`, so change this value to anything else and the tests will pass.

# 3. Transfer
## Multiple Arguments

Calling solidity contracts with multiple arguments in ethers.js is not much different from what you might expect!

We can define an `Adder` contract:
```
// Adder.sol
contract Adder {
    function add(uint x, uint y) external pure returns(uint) {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```
Then we can call the contract from our JavaScript side:
```js
// callAdder.js
async function callAdder(adderContract) {
    const sum = await adderContract.add(1,4); 
    console.log(sum); // 5
}
```
Voilà! Multiple function arguments! 🎩
## 🏁 Your Goal: Transfer

1. In the `index.js` file, complete the `transfer` function to transfer value from the contract signer to the `friend` address.
2. The signer will also be the deployer of the contract. Their balance will be `1000` after deploying the contract.
3. Your task is to transfer some of this to the `friend`. It can be however much you want!

# 4. Signer
## Signer

We've talked about the **signer** quite a bit in the past few stages, but what is it, exactly?

A signer represents an EOA we have control over. We can use it to sign transactions before sending them to the network.

When we create a Contract instance we connect with a signer so that we can transact with the contract easily!

We can also connect the contract with other signers when we need to run the same transaction with different addresses:
```js
// createUsers.js
async function createUsers(contract, signers) {
    for(let i = 0; i < signers.length; i++) {
        await contract.connect(signers[i]).createUser();
    }
}
```
☝️ In this example we are connecting the contract with different signers and calling the `createUser` method with each one.

    📖 The function connect returns a new instance of contract connected with this signer. This makes it possible to "chain" the function with the method call to createUser as shown above. Each call will be made with a different signer.

The `msg.sender` value inside the contract will be the address of these users:
```
// Contract.sol
import "hardhat/console.sol";
contract Contract {
    function createUser() external view {
        console.log(msg.sender); // 0xabc…
    }
}
```
☝️ The `createUser` function will be called once for each signer in the `signers` array.
## 🏁 Your Goal: Set Message

1. In the Contract you will find a `message` state variable. Your goal is to modify the message to contain anything other than an empty string.
2. The only problem is the `owner` cannot change this message! You'll need to connect the contract to a different `signer` in order to change it. In the `index.js` file you'll have access to the contract and a different `signer`.

# 5. Deposit
## Value Transfer

We're making some strong progress! Up to this point we have called functions, made transactions and sent function arguments with both.

Now it's time to learn how to send **ether** with our transaction!

Let's consider a contract with a `payable` function:
```
// Charities.sol
contract Charities {
    mapping(uint => uint) balances;
    function donate(uint id) external payable {
        balances[id] += msg.value;
    }
}
```
☝️ Each charity has an `id` that maps to a `uint` balance. The donate function will add the value sent to the function to the associated charity's balance.

We can call the `donate` method from ethers.js and provide ether:
```js
// donate.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
async function donate(contract, charityId) {
    await contract.donate(charityId, {
        value: ethers.utils.parseEther("5")
    });
}
```
☝️ This will send 5 ETH to the donate function which will store it in the `balances` mapping associated with the `charityId`.

You'll notice that the first argument passed here was the `charityId`, matching the Solidity signature. The second argument we passed in is called the **overrides** object. In this object we can specify the **value**, which is how much ether we'd like to send. This object must be passed in **last** after all the other argument functions.

    📖 Along with the value there are four other values that can be specified in the overrides object of a transaction: gasLimit, gasPrice, nonce and chainId.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Make a Deposit

Complete the `deposit` function within the `index.js` to call the contract and deposit at *least* 1 ether.
