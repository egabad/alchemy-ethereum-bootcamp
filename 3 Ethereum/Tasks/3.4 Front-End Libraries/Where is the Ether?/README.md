# 1. Where is the Ether?
## Where is the Ether?

If you take a look at the test cases you'll see that there will be three blocks mined with several transactions in each one.

The addresses where the ether is sent to will be **randomly** generated. It is up to you to find all of these addresses and return them in an array.
## Your Goal: Find the Addresses

The `findEther` function is passed an `address` which has sent ether to several addresses. The goal of this function is to find every address that has received ether and return it in an array of addresses.
