# 1. Blocks and Hashes
## Blocks and Hashes

Blockchain is aptly named! It is, in fact, a **chain of blocks**.

Each block contains **transactional data**, some **metadata** describing the block itself, and a **link** to the previous block before it. These components are fed into a [hash function](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/sc/5b3afd70d9f99763e5c4b4fe/stage/5b3afdd3d9f99763e5c4b502?tab=details&scroll=Hash%20Function) to create a unique sequence of bits to represent the block.
## Your Goal: Return a Hash

In your `Block.js` file, we have a class `Block`. Using the `SHA256` function from the [Crypto JS Library](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/sc/5b3afd70d9f99763e5c4b4fe/stage/5b3afdd3d9f99763e5c4b502?tab=details&scroll=Crypto-JS), return a valid hash in the `toHash` function.

For now, there's no need to hash anything in particular since the block contains none of the components we mentioned above.

    Feel free to hash a message, your own name, or nothing at all! So long as it is a 64 character hexadecimal string you will pass this stage.

# 2. What's in a Hash?
## Adding Data to the Hash

Now it's time to add `data` to our hash. This will ensure that the block's hash is [tied to its contents](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/sc/5b3afd70d9f99763e5c4b4fe/stage/5b3b0b26d9f99763e5c4b518?tab=details)!
## Your Goal: Hash the Data

When creating a new block, `data` will be passed to its constructor:

```js
const block = new Block("Alice sent Bob 1 BTC");

console.log( block.data ); // Alice sent Bob 1 BTC
```

As shown above, let's add a `data` property to the `Block`.

1. Add a constructor to our `Block` class that takes one argument data and assigns it to `this.data`
2. Once you have added data to the `block`, use this data to calculate the block's hash in the `toHash` function!

# 3. The Genesis Block
## Blockchain Time

We have a new file: `Blockchain.js`. How exciting!

This stage is going to focus on adding the first block to our new Blockchain class! The first block is often referred to as the [Genesis Block](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/sc/5b3afd70d9f99763e5c4b4fe/stage/5b3ba85bd9f997b30859bb70?tab=details).
## Your Goal: Add the Genesis Block

The `Blockchain.js` file contains the `Blockchain` class with a `chain` array. Let's add the **Genesis Block** to this array.

Create a `new Block` in the Blockchain constructor then add it to the `chain` array.

# 4. Adding Blocks
## Your Goal: Create an addBlock Function

Let's create an `addBlock` function on our `Blockchain` class.

This function should take in a new block and add it to the `chain` array:
```js
const blockchain = new Blockchain();
const block = new Block("Charlie sent Dave 2 BTC");

blockchain.addBlock(block);

console.log(blockchain.chain.length); // 2
```
Remember we should have both the genesis block **and** the new block now.

# 5. Linking the Blocks
## Previous Hash

It's time to add one more **crucial** input to our block's hash calculation: the **hash of the previous block** in the chain.

![Linking Blocks](https://res.cloudinary.com/divzjiip8/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1580327751/Frame_1_86_vctqau.png)

This creates a chain where any change to the data of an earlier block will affect each subsequent block.

    Let's take a look at what a change would do in details.

## Your Goal: Link Blocks

To link the blocks you have to accomplish two things:

1. Add a `previousHash` property to each block. The value of this property should be the hash of the block **before it** in the chain.
2. Use this `previousHash` property in the calculation of the block's hash.

    ðŸ’¡ Hints

    - A good spot to add the `previousHash` property on the block would be in the `addBlock` function, where a block is placed on the chain.
    - So far, the `Block` class in your `Block.js` file does not yet contain a `previousHash` property and currently only hashes `this.data` of a block - you must also include the block's `this.previousHash` property in the `toHash` function!
    - You can add multiple inputs to the SHA256 function by using the + operator, for example:
        ```js
        const hash = SHA256("dog" + "cat); // hash of dog and cat together
        ```
# 6. Validating the Chain
## Chain Validation

Blockchains are run by a network of computers. When a computer finds a new block, it broadcasts its new version of the blockchain to all of its peers. There may be multiple versions of the blockchain at any given time. However, the **longest valid blockchain** is the accepted one.

    Let's take a closer look at the logic behind this in details.

## Your Goal: Create an isValid Function

1. Create a function called `isValid` on our `Blockchain` that will return `true` or `false` if a block is valid or invalid respectively
2. `isValid` should check the integrity of every block in its chain by looking at each block's `previousHash` field and making sure that it is equal to the hash of the block before it

ðŸ’¡ Hint

    To compare the output of the SHA256 function you will need to convert it into a string (.toString) before comparing. Example:
```js
const hash1 = SHA256("a");
const hash2 = SHA256("a");

console.log(hash1 === hash2); // false
console.log(hash1.toString() === hash2.toString()); // true
```
    Notice that first one is false! These two are objects and are compared by reference which is why we need to convert it to a string!
